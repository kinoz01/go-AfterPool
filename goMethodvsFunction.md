In Go (Golang), the terms "func" and "method" have specific meanings and usages:

1. Func (Function): A function in Go is a standalone block of code that can perform a specific task and is defined outside of any type. It can take zero or more arguments and return zero or more values. Functions are not bound to any data structure or type by themselves.  
**Example of a Function:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// A simple function that adds two integers
func add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    result := add(3, 4)
    fmt.Println(result) // Outputs: 7
}
```

2. Method: A method in Go is similar to a function but is defined with a specific receiver type. A method is associated with the receiver's type and can access the data of the object that it is called upon.  
**Example of a Method:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}

// Method that calculates the area of a rectangle
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}

func main() {
    rect := Rectangle{width: 10, height: 5}
    area := rect.Area() // Calls the Area method on Rectangle object
    fmt.Println(area) // Outputs: 50
}
```

## When is it strictly necessary to use a method?

Methods are strictly necessary when you need to execute functionality that is inherently tied to the data of a particular type. This is especially important in object-oriented design principles where operations on data should be encapsulated within the type itself.

**Example Scenario:**

We'll define a Shaper interface that includes multiple types of geometric shapes. Each shape will implement the Shaper interface by providing methods to calculate the area and the perimeter. This example demonstrates how interfaces can be used to abstract behavior across different types, allowing for polymorphic behavior.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

// Shaper interface with methods to calculate area and perimeter
type Shaper interface {
    Area() float64
    Perimeter() float64
}

// Circle type with a radius
type Circle struct {
    radius float64
}

// Area method for Circle
func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}

// Perimeter method for Circle
func (c Circle) Perimeter() float64 {
    return 2 * math.Pi * c.radius
}

// Rectangle type with width and height
type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}

// Area method for Rectangle
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}

// Perimeter method for Rectangle
func (r Rectangle) Perimeter() float64 {
    return 2 * (r.width + r.height)
}

// Function to calculate the properties of various shapes
func printShapeInfo(s Shaper) {
    fmt.Printf("Area: %.2f\n", s.Area())
    fmt.Printf("Perimeter: %.2f\n", s.Perimeter())
}

func main() {
    circle := Circle{radius: 5}
    rectangle := Rectangle{width: 10, height: 5}

    fmt.Println("Circle:")
    printShapeInfo(circle)

    fmt.Println("Rectangle:")
    printShapeInfo(rectangle)
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Interface Definition**: The `Shaper` interface is defined with two methods: `Area()` and `Perimeter()`. Any type that implements both of these methods is a `Shaper`.  

2. Circle and Rectangle Implementations: Both Circle and Rectangle types implement the Shaper interface by providing implementations for Area() and Perimeter() methods.

3. Polymorphism: The printShapeInfo function takes a Shaper as an argument, allowing it to operate on any type that fulfills the Shaper interface. This demonstrates polymorphism where the same function is used to operate on objects of different types.

4. Main Function: Creates instances of Circle and Rectangle, and uses printShapeInfo to print their area and perimeter. This showcases how interfaces can be used to write functions that can work with any implementing type without knowing the specifics of each type.

In Go, polymorphism is achieved through interfaces. An interface defines a contract, or a set of methods that must be implemented by any type that claims to satisfy the interface. When a function, such as `printShapeInfo` in our example, accepts an interface type as a parameter, it can work with any value that has implemented the methods defined in the interface. This is a core concept of polymorphism â€” the ability to treat different types in a uniform way based on the methods they implement.

*This means that the `printShapeInfo` function can accept any type that implements the methods defined in the `Shaper` interface.*


### Breaking Down the Concept of polymorphism Further:

Interface as a Contract: In our example, the Shaper interface is a contract that requires implementing types to have an Area() and a Perimeter() method. This doesn't tie the function to any specific type like Circle or Rectangle. Instead, it ties the function to a set of behaviors.

Type Independence: The function printShapeInfo doesn't need to know the specific type of the object. It only needs to know that whatever object it is dealing with can perform the Area() and Perimeter() operations. This is possible because both Circle and Rectangle declare that they satisfy the Shaper interface by implementing these methods.

Polymorphic Functionality: This ability to interact with different types based on a common set of operations is what allows polymorphism. printShapeInfo can handle any type that implements Shaper. If you were to introduce a new geometric shape, such as a Triangle, and implement the same Shaper interface for it, printShapeInfo would be able to handle Triangle instances without any modifications. This makes the function highly flexible and extensible.

Code Reusability and Flexibility: By using interfaces, your code becomes more reusable and flexible. You can add new types that implement the Shaper interface without changing the existing functions that use the interface. This also helps in reducing the coupling between components of the software, leading to easier maintenance and evolution of the codebase.


**Note:**

In Go, if you have a struct that only implements one of the methods required by an interface, then it does not satisfy that interface. A type must implement all methods declared in an interface to be considered an instance of that interface. This is a strict rule in Go's type system to ensure that any type claiming to satisfy an interface can actually fulfill all the contractual obligations that the interface defines.
